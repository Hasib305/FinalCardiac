# CardiacRecord Android_app
**CardiacRecord****CardiacRecord** is an app which will allow users to monitor their _Blood pressure_ & _Heart Rate_ data. Unlike other services, CardiacRecorder is free and open source.


Obtaining an accurate blood pressure history is crucial for assessing the risk of heart disease and stroke. It is essential to avoid false reassurances about one's health by ensuring that blood pressure readings accurately reflect the actual condition. Relying on lower-than-actual readings may lead to a misleading perception of one's cardiovascular health, highlighting the significance of obtaining precise measurements for a comprehensive understanding of individual risk factors.
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/Hasib305/FinalCardiac/wiki) for documentation, implementation details and history.
